# TABLES-REST-API
 Hello!\
 Why don't we have a REST API for Yandex tables?\
Many companies that migrated from Google or MS cloud tables have encountered problems.\
Yandex Cloud definitely has a big disadvantage in this area.\

I am working on the onlyoffice-documents server integration now, will write some c++/python code. \
I would be glad to participate in such a useful project as Yandex Tables API. =) \
Regards
